Input_POGENOM
=============

This pipeline generates the required input files for POGENOM.
The aim of this pipeline is to increase the reproducibility of the data analysis, and to simplify the use of POGENOM.
POGENOM is a computer program that calculates several population genetic parameters for a genome in relation to a set of samples (https://github.com/EnvGen/POGENOM).
POGENOM takes as input a file of the variant call format.
This input file is generated by mapping one or several metagenomic samples against a reference genome with a read-aligner and calling variants using a variant caller.
