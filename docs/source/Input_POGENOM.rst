Input POGENOM
=============

This pipeline generates the required input file for POGENOM (A VCF file). The aim of this pipeline is to increase the reproducibility of the data analysis, and to simplify the use of POGENOM, especially for large datasets. POGENOM takes as input a file of the variant call format. This input file is generated by mapping one or several metagenomic samples against a reference genome with a read-aligner and calling variants using a variant caller. These steps are automatically done by this pipeline.
